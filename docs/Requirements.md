User Story 1 : As a User, i want to talk so that it retranscript my voice on the screen
- Connect the microphone and the Arduino in order to detect our voice
- Record or transmit the data from our voice to the application
- Convert the data of the voice to some text data
- Display this text from the leds Board

User Story 2 : As a User, I want to translate what i am saying through the screen so that i can talk in my own language and the person can still understand me
